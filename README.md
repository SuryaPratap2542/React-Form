## Tailwind CSS Integration

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework, for styling. Key points about Tailwind CSS integration:

- CSS classes from Tailwind CSS are used to style the form elements.
- The form is enclosed in a container with a `shadow` and `rounded` styling.
